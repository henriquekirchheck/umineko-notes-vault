## Description

> I created everything. My fortune! My prestige! Everything!!

He is really arrogant, seems to have gotten really rich after being born in a impoverished situation. Describes children as foolish.
His children appear to have abandoned him.

> I was born with nothing. I will die with nothing! There is nothing I wish to leave to my foolish children.

Doesn't seem to fear death, even with his incoming demise as described by his [[Nanjo Tesumasa|Physician]].

> Nothing!! After I'm gone, I care not if it all goes to waste! I desire no tomb, no coffin!! Those were the terms of the contract I made with the witch! When I die, everything will be lost.

Strange relationship with so called Witch. A contract was formed that will wipe his soul out of existence (this is described by him as being devoured by demons).

Says to have only one regret, he describes it has to be resolved before his death due to the aforementioned contract as he will have no peace or another world after death.

Wants to see [[Beatrice]] one last time. Important enough to say that he would lose everything to see her one last time. Describes her as "resisting" him. Wants for her to hear his final plea.

> You're ([[Beatrice]]) here, aren't you?! You're standing there invisible, listening to every word I say, and even now you're mocking me from somewhere in this room ([[Study]]), aren't you?!

He begs for [[Beatrice]] to appear, to scold him or even kill him if she so desires.
