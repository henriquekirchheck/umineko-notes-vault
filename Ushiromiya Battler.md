## Description

Doesn't want to smoke, but always wanted to try drinking. Planned to drink for the first time today ([[1986-10-04]]).

Seems to have a fear of shaking, or at least gets sick in situations where shaking is prevalent.

Still a minor.

> I guess I have all that muscle training and those shady mail-order performance-enhancing drugs to thank for that.

Has used drugs before, what kind of performance enhancing drugs are still not known.

Thinks his name, "Battler", is really weird.

> Since the Ushiromiya cousins consist of two boys and three girls, I ended up playing with [[Ushiromiya George]] all the time.
> And because I've always thought of him as a big brother, I still call him "[[Ushiromiya George|Aniki]]" today.

> It must be in his blood \[about his height\], I suppose. [[Rudolf]] wasn't that tall either until around his high school years.
